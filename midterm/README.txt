I used 2 flex containers. One for markets, news and personal informations and the other is for links.
I used flex items and nested flex items for all 3 sections inside of the first container.
I used max height and overflow-y: auto to be able to scroll down the news section.

I used smaller flex container for links section and added university links inside of seperate flex items.
